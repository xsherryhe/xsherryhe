![Hi, I'm Sherry](./images/banner.png)

- I'm a developer whose interests lie in front-end and full-stack web development.
- I have a background in education and linguistics. In these areas as well as in programming, I'm all about using research and systems thinking to piece together puzzles and solve problems.
- I'm currently working on [an educational course-hosting website](https://github.com/xsherryhe/matter-of-course).
- I'm **actively looking to collaborate**! Get in touch if you:
  - Are looking for contributors for your project
  - Have an idea, suggestion, or bug fix for one of my projects
